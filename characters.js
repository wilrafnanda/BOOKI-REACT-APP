When he finishes school, this academic distinction plus his having served as Head Boy secures him a job in the Ministry in Goblet of Fire. Percy somewhat idolises his immediate supervisor, Barty Crouch Sr. When Crouch is ill, Percy replaces him as a judge in the second Triwizard Tournament task.

    In Order of the Phoenix, Percy is promoted to Junior Assistant to Minister Fudge.

Draco, adhering to his family's beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet Mudbloods, should be denied a magical education.

Philip Nel believes that Malfoy is derived from the French phrase mal foi, meaning "bad faith".[4] In an article published in 2002, Nilsen and Nilsen argue that "Draco" has connotations with draconian, and that his name starts with "mal", a French prefix for "bad" or "evil".`,

    "info":`ellatrix Black was born to Cygnus and Druella (Rosier) Black in 1951.
        Bellatrix is related by blood and marriage to many characters in the novels (although in the fifth book it is specified that all pure-blood families are related to each other): she has two younger sisters, Narcissa and Andromeda, and is first cousin to Sirius. She married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts "because it was expected of her" to marry a pure-blood. However, Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix truly loved Voldemort.[2] Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, and was subsequently disowned by the Blacks, whereas Narcissa, conversely, married Lucius Malfoy, heir of a wealthy pure-blood family; thus, Bellatrix is the aunt of both Nymphadora Tonks and Draco Malfoy.

        At Hogwarts, she, along with her sisters, was sorted into Slytherin. It is suggested in the novels that, as a student, Bellatrix associated with a group of students – including Rodolphus Lestrange, Severus Snape, Avery, Evan Rosier and Wilkes – who nearly all became Death Eaters. It is assumed Bellatrix was at least initially drawn to Lord Voldemort because they both believe in an ideology that favors pure-blood wizards and witches over other members of the community.`,

    "info":`In a 1999 interview, Rowling claimed Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry Potter, and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort's backstory at first. "The basic idea [was that Harry] didn't know he was a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And—so—but for some mysterious reason the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since`,

    "info":`Cedric Diggory might be what Harry would be like if Harry didn't have a Grand Destiny to face Voldemort sooner or later. He's handsome, brave, loyal, and kind. He believes in fair play. He's the Seeker for Hufflepuff's Quidditch team. And he's dating Cho Chang, a fifth-year and Harry's current crush. When Harry falls from his broom during third year thanks to a Dementor attack, Cedric catches the Snitch, giving Harry the only Quidditch defeat he's had so far at Hogwarts. Cedric and Harry seem pretty evenly matched.

    Because they're decent guys, even though they're competing with each other, Cedric and Harry go back and forth helping each other with the different Triwizard tasks. Harry starts it off by telling Cedric about the dragons in the first task. Cedric is a bit suspicious to start with – "Why are you telling me?" (20.35) – because he seems to buy some of Harry's bad press about being a glory-seeker. But, Cedric quickly comes around.`,

His and Lily’s love is vital to Harry, and Harry’s deepest desire is to see them again, which is why he sees their reflection in the Mirror of Erised.
